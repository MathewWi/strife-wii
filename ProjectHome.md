## What is Strife Wii? ##
Strife Wii is a port of Rogue Entertainment's FPS game Strife to the Nintendo Wii. By porting the SvStrife 1.4 engine (which is based on the PrBoom 2.2.3 engine), users are to use homebrew to play Strife on the Nintendo Wii.

## Project Status ##
This project is currently in a non-working state. Arikado has done all of the work thus far. This SVN was created so that Arikado and jendave could work on the project together and bring it into a working state. Currently an endianness issue prevents the program from being able to launch the WAD files.

## Usage ##
Place strife1.wad, voices.wad, svstrife.wad, and prboom.wad into sd:/apps/strifewii/data/ to use the program. Note that the program will just return you to the hbc due to the endianness issue with reading the files. Hopefully the program will be in a playable state very soon.
