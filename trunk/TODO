Entrys marked by a * are fixed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Rearrange the frame structure.

The frame structure in info.h needs to be rearranged so that seh support can fully work. I also need to remove
extra frames that is no longer needed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Auto health

In Strife, health in the player's inventory is automatically used if health is lower than 40.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Demo support

Prboom's demo code is so badly broken that it may take a long time to get it back up again, and getting it
to work with Strife's features may even take longer.
